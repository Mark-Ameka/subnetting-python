# Subnetting Program System (C to Python Conversion)

This project is a subnetting program system originally written in C and later translated to Python. The conversion process aimed to maintain the functionality and features of the original C implementation while adapting to the syntax and conventions of Python.

The conversion of this system from C to Python was based on the following GitHub repository:
[GitHub - ip_address-subnet_mask](https://github.com/Mark-Ameka/ip_address-subnet_mask.git)

## Overview

The subnetting program allows users to perform various operations related to IP addresses and subnet masks. It provides a user-friendly interface for subnetting calculations and network configuration.

The original repository served as a reference for the core functionality and algorithms. The conversion process involved rewriting the code in Python, ensuring compatibility, and making necessary adjustments to adhere to Python's syntax and best practices.
